# PLA TempTower 220 180°C

This part is used to print a tower, printed with a different temperature setting for each floor. To help you to change these temperatures a postprocessing script is provided in this Plugin to easily define this tower.

## Printing Conditions
     - Nozzle Size : 0.4
     - Layer Height : 0.16
     - Initial Layer Height : 0.2
     - Line Width : 0.4
     - Wall Line Count : 3
     - Top/Bottom Thickness : 0.8 mm
     - Enable Bridge Settings : True

**Printing Time = 1h50mn**


## Results
The goal is to choose the highest temperature possible that doesn't produce artifacts.

First, you have to analyse the tower. Each floor has the according to the temperature written on it.

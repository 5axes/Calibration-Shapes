# Flow Test

If your flow rate is well calibrated, your top and bottom layers should look great. But there are some time where you might find signs of over extrusion or under extrusions on your 3D printed models.

This issue can be mitigated by changing the flow rate of your bottom or top layer flow rate.

### Printing Conditions
     - Nozzle Size : 0.4
     - Layer Height : 0.2
     - Initial Layer Height : 0.2
     - Line Width : 0.4
     - Wall Line Count : 3
     - Top/Bottom Thickness : 0.8 mm
     - Infill Density : 8%


**Printing Time = 10mn**

## Instructions

Print the test part. After the print is finished, check the quality of your top and bottom layers. If they are over-extruded, you need to lower to the top layer flow rate in Cura.

#Test Part

You can add files to this repository via a pull request, but there are a couple of rules that should be enforced :

* The model must be provided as an OpenSCAD project : [OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org/)
* The printing time must be around 2 hours maximum as these parts should be used as basic calibration models.
* After conversion into a STL format, files should be no larger than 2MB. This prevents getting a huge Git history.
* All files will be published under the CC0 Creative Commons license. Make sure that you have the right to publish it as such.
* The maintainer of this repository reserve the final arbitrage to judge whether it is appropriate for a model to be shared under the premise that it tests certain slicer features or machine capabilities.

#Postprocessing scripts

Several postprocessing scripts are included into the plugin to help the user to generate automaticaly the differents Towers.

- [RetractTower.py](https://github.com/5axes/Calibration-Shapes/blob/master/resources/RetractTower.py)
- [SpeedTower.py](https://github.com/5axes/Calibration-Shapes/blob/master/resources/SpeedTower.py)
- [TempFanTower.py](https://github.com/5axes/Calibration-Shapes/blob/master/resources/TempFanTower.py)

These scripts can be copied into the scripts directory via the function **Copy Scripts**

After the next start the scripts must be visible in the Postprocessing scripts.

# Retract Tower

Sample part to properly calibrate the retraction. It’s important to do this step after calibrating the filament temperature to ensure consistent results. The retraction values can change according to temperature so it’s better to do this at the end. To set the retract calibration you can use the associated Postprocessing script. 

You need to calibrate first the rectract distance, then you can tune the speed extruder retraction.
